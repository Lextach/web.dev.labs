								Football (Soccer) is one of the oldest sports in the world and with that; it’s also one of the most
								recognised. The
								pinnacle of the international game comes in the form the Football World Cup. There are also tournament
								such as the Euro
								Championships, Copa America and the African Cup of Nations. Domestically the strongest leagues come from
								England
								(English Premier League), Spain (La Liga), Italy (Serie A) and Germany (Bundesliga). In parts of the
								world the sport is
								also known as Soccer.
							</li>
							<li><b>Object of the Game</b>
								The aim of football is to score more goals then your opponent in a 90 minute playing time frame. The
								match is split up
								into two halves of 45 minutes. After the first 45 minutes players will take a 15 minute rest period
								called half time.
								The second 45 minutes will resume and any time deemed fit to be added on by the referee (injury time)
								will be
								accordingly.</li>
							<li><b>Players & Equipment</b>
								Each team consists of 11 players. These are made up of one goalkeeper and ten outfield players. The
								pitch dimensions
								vary from each ground but are roughly 120 yards long and 75 yards wide. On each pitch you will have a 6
								yard box next to
								the goal mouth, an 18 yard box surrounding the 6 yard box and a centre circle. Each half of the pitch
								must be a mirror
								image of the other in terms of dimensions.

								Essentially the equipment that is needed for a soccer match is pitch and a football. Additionally
								players can be found
								wearing studded football boots, shin pads and matching strips. The goalkeepers will additionally wear
								padded gloves as
								they are the only players allowed to handle the ball. Each team will have a designated captain.</li>

						<p>Conclusion
							Football is more than a sport; it is a global phenomenon that influences and is influenced by societal,
							economic,
							scientific, and technological factors. It brings joy and despair, unites and divides, and prompts
							reflection
							and action.
							As it continues to evolve, it will undoubtedly continue to captivate the hearts and minds of millions
							worldwide.</p>
