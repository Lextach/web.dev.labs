				<li>Football (Soccer) RulesFootball (Soccer) Photo credit:
					<p> Rick Dikeman (source) Football (Soccer) is one of the oldest
						sports in the world and with that; it’s also one of the most recognised. The pinnacle of the international
						game comes in
						the form the Football World Cup. There are also tournament such as the Euro Championships, Copa America and
						the African
						Cup of Nations. Domestically the strongest leagues come from England (English Premier League), Spain (La
						Liga), Italy
						(Serie A) and Germany (Bundesliga). In parts of the world the sport is also known as Soccer.</p>
				</li>
				<li>Object of the Game:
					<p>
						The aim of football is to score more goals then your opponent in a 90 minute playing time frame. The
						match is split up into two halves of 45 minutes. After the first 45 minutes players will take a 15 minute
						rest period
						called half time. The second 45 minutes will resume and any time deemed fit to be added on by the referee
						(injury time)
						will be accordingly.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>Players & Equipment:
					<p>
						Each team consists of 11 players. These are made up of one goalkeeper and ten outfield players. The
						pitch dimensions vary from each ground but are roughly 120 yards long and 75 yards wide. On each pitch you
						will have a 6
						yard box next to the goal mouth, an 18 yard box surrounding the 6 yard box and a centre circle. Each half of
						the pitch
						must be a mirror image of the other in terms of dimensions. Essentially the equipment that is needed for a
						soccer match
						is pitch and a football. Additionally players can be found wearing studded football boots, shin pads and
						matching
						strips. The goalkeepers will additionally wear padded gloves as they are the only players allowed to handle
						the ball.
						Each team will have a designated captain.
