								<p>The game of basketball was first played almost 128 years ago. The date of the first-ever basketball
									match was 21st
									December 1891. The beginning of a basketball era came in Massachusetts, the United States by the hands
									of an American
									gym teacher. The game then took its route and spread across Canada and gradually in many other parts
									of the world. In
									present times, basketball is a sport that is played internationally.</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<p>It is a fun sport that is played across various courts. The professional court is, however, of a
									fixed size. It usually
									measures 90 feet by 50 feet and a wooden floor. Each team gets two points for scoring a goal. In case
									of a foul, a
									penalty is given to the other team, and it comes as free throws. The game is not gendered specific and
									is played by both
									men and women.</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<p>There is a referee in the basketball matches, who begins the game. He tosses the ball in the court in
									the presence of
									one player from each team. Whoever gets his hands on the ball first has an advantage. He passes on the
									ball to his
									teammates, and the game begins. The team which can score maximum points till the end are declared the
									winner.</p>

						<p>Finally, sources like articles, blogs, and podcasts provide authors and consumers with opinionated and
							subjective pieces
							of work. You can use any one of these genres yourself to go into depth with a specific theme. With these
							tools, you can
							find new ways to read about things that interest you or topics you are conducting research on.
