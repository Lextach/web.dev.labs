						<p><strong>History of tennis</strong>
							Most historians consider French monks to be the first who played this game nearly in the 10th or 11th
							centuries. It is
							believed that they played a crude handball against the wall or over the rope strung across the yard. The
							name of the
							game comes from the word jeu de paume that means ‘game of the hand’ (Cooper, n.d.). Other historians
							believe
							that the
							name of the game takes roots from the French word tenez denoting something that can be taken from one
							player
							to another.
							When the game became more popular, it began to be played indoors using the same equipment including the
							ball, the wall,
							or the rope. Playing with a crude ball was inconvenient with bare hands, and players started to use gloves
							to protect
							their hands, and further on a racquet got in use. The ball used in the game was modified later too, and it
							was done with
							the help of a wad of hair, cork, or wool wrapped in cloth or leather.

							This game was considered to be the privilege of high classes as far as the first ones who played this game
							were monks.
							Despite the prohibitions of the Pope and Louis lV, this game spread all over the world and English kings
							Henry Vll and
							Henry Vlll were the ardent players of this game. The racquet was changed by 1500, and it was made of a
							wooden frame
							strung with sheep gut (Cooper, n.d.). This new racquet as well as a cork-cored ball made the game easier
							and
							more
							interesting. The ball weighed three ounces was more convenient to play with it. The tennis courts used by
							royal families
							differed from modern ones. The first tennis court that resembled the modern one was constructed in 1625
							and
							it was
							England’s Hampton Court that is still used in our times (Cooper, n.d.). It is a narrow indoor court so
							that
							the ball may
							be played against the wall.</p>

						<p><b>Conclusion</b>
							Tennis has become one of the most popular games all over the world. Everyone may enjoy playing this game
							professionally
							or with friends in their free time. The rules of this game are not very complicated, and it does not need
							supernatural
							abilities to play tennis. This game is quite simple to be taught to play. There are not only benefits for
							your physical,
							mental, and emotional development, but this game makes fun, and it is the best way of spending free time
							with your
							friends.
